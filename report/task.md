# Task for Master Thesis

## Topic

Research and implementation of multi-dataset training for image classification with discrepant taxonomies.

## Description

Image classification is a major task in computer vision.
While many different approaches have been proposed, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown to be particularly successful in this domain.
However, domain shifts between training and inference data can lead to a decrease in performance.
This problem might be mitigated through multi-dataset training, which in turn creates a new challenge: how to handle discrepant taxonomies between datasets.

This thesis aims to investigate the problem of multi-dataset training for image classification with discrepant taxonomies.
Within the scope of this thesis, it is necessary become acquainted with relevant machine learning libraries for handling tensors and images as well as automatic differentiation frameworks.
Experiments will be done on suitable publicly available image classification datasets which reflect the problem of discrepant taxonomies.
Different approaches for multi-dataset image classification will be implemented and their performance compared to suitable baselines.
The work will produce source code for further research, trained models as well as a written report.
