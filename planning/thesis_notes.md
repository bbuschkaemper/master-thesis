# Notes for writing thesis

- Look if any paper in zotero wasn't cited
- Explain training process and parameters in detail
- Explain the original taxonomy algorithm from Bevandic paper and what we changed (classification vs. segmentation, weighted vs. unweighted, multi-domain vs. 2 domains, etc.)
- The Missing Link paper as reference in thresholding section
- Add examples from universal taxonomy generation and explain where it got right and where it got wrong and interpret the results
- Canva for figures (create graphics for method and results)
