\caption{Universal model evaluation results on multi-domain test datasets. Two-domain models were trained on Caltech-101 + Caltech-256, while the three-domain model was trained on all three datasets. Models were evaluated on individual domains as well as the combined test set. Domain accuracy values show performance compared to single-domain ResNet-50 baselines (Caltech-101: 97.23\%, Caltech-256: 75.65\%, CIFAR-100: 78.26\%). All accuracy values are shown as percentages.}
