\caption{Universal model evaluation results on multi-domain Caltech-101 + Caltech-256 test dataset. Models were trained on both domains simultaneously and evaluated on individual domains as well as the combined test set. Domain accuracy values show performance compared to single-domain ResNet-50 baselines (Caltech-101: 97.23\%, Caltech-256: 75.65\%). All accuracy values are shown as percentages.}
